Assignment: Week 5 - Containerization with Docker Objective: By the end of this assignment, you will have a solid understanding of containerization with Docker, including its advantages, architecture, and practical implementation. You will gain hands-on experience in building, running, managing Docker containers, and understanding Docker networking and storage solutions.

Instructions: Complete the following tasks by the end of the week. Submit your completed work via the provided submission platform, including any code, configuration files, and a written report detailing your findings and reflections.

Task 1: Introduction to Containerization Research and Report: Write a 500-word report explaining the concept of containerization. Include the following points: Definition and purpose of containerization. Advantages of containerization for consistency and scalability. Comparison of containerization vs. virtualization, highlighting key differences and use cases.

Task 2: Understanding Docker and Container Basics Docker Installation: Install Docker on your local machine. Provide a screenshot showing Docker running successfully on your system. Docker Architecture and Components: Write a brief description (300 words) of the Docker architecture. Explain the roles of the following components: Docker Daemon Docker Client Docker Images Docker Containers Docker Registries

Task 3: Hands-On Practical with Docker Explore Docker Images, Containers, and Dockerfile: Create a simple Dockerfile for a basic web application using the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/josephifekwe97/my-app.git.. Your Dockerfile should: Use an official base image. Copy application code into the container. Install necessary dependencies. Expose a port. Define a CMD to run the application. Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile and provide the command used to build it. Run a container using the built image and provide the command used to run it. Creating and Managing Docker Containers: List all Docker containers on your system and provide the command used to list them. Start, stop, and remove a Docker container. Provide the commands used for each action.

Task 4: Container Orchestration and Networking Docker Networking Models: Write a brief explanation (200 words) of the different Docker networking models. Focus on the following: Bridge Network Host Network Overlay Network Hands-On Networking: Create a user-defined bridge network. Run two containers on this network and demonstrate that they can communicate with each other. Provide the commands used and a brief explanation of your process.

Task 5: Docker Networking and Storage Explore Docker Networking: Set up a Docker container with a custom network configuration. Provide the network configuration details and commands used to set it up. Persistent Storage Solutions: Research and explain (200 words) the concept of persistent storage in Docker. Include common solutions such as volumes and bind mounts. Create a Docker container with a mounted volume. Provide the Docker run command used and verify that data persists after container termination and restart.
