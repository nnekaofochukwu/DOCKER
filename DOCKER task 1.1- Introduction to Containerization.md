Containerization: An Overview

Definition and Purpose

Containerization is a software deployment process that bundles an application's code and its required files and libraries into a container. 
This container isolates the application so it can run consistently in any environment and on any infrastructure, even if it uses a different operating system (OS)
Instead of copying the hardware layer, containerization removes the operating system layer from the self-contained environment. 
This allows the application to run independently from the host operating system. 
Containerization prevents resource waste because applications are provided with the exact resources they need

The primary purpose of containerization is to create lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that simplify the development, testing,
deployment, and scaling of applications.


Advantages of containerization for consistency and scalability.

Containerization can provide several advantages for consistency and scalability, including:

Portability
Containers can be easily moved between hosts, allowing for quick scaling up or down as needed. 
This can be especially helpful during unexpected traffic spikes. 
Because containers include everything required for an application to run, they can also ensure consistency across different environments, 
such as development, testing, and production. This can help to avoid issues where an application works in one environment but not another.

Resource efficiency
Containers are lightweight and don't require a separate operating system, so they use fewer resources than traditional virtual machines (VMs). 
For example, while VMs are typically a few gigabytes in size, containers are often only tens of megabytes. 
This means that a server can run many more containers than VMs. Containers can also improve efficiency by using all available resources and minimizing overhead.

Improved security
Containerization can make applications more secure by providing an extra layer of isolation. 
This ensures that applications run within a self-contained environment, so if one container is compromised, the others on the same host won't be affected. 

Other advantages of containerization include:
Isolation: Can help manage multiple CI/CD pipelines
Fast deployment: Allows for rapid scaling without the need to duplicate unnecessary services



Comparison of containerization vs. virtualization, highlighting key differences and use cases.

Virtualization allows you to create virtual machines (VMs) from underlying hardware resources using an abstraction layer known as a hypervisor. 
You can create and launch multiple virtual machines from a single physical machine, each running a different operating system. 
Virtual machines share the same resources, such as memory, storage, and processors, with the host system they are running on.

Containerization is a form of virtualization in which an application is bundled along with its code, libraries, dependencies, 
and everything else needed for it to run inside a component known as a container. 
A container is a lightweight and portable unit that runs consistently across any computing platform. 
Containers are more resource-efficient and scalable than virtual machines. 
Unlike VMs, they share the same OS kernel as the host, and there’s no abstraction of hardware resources. 
Containers are key components of microservices architecture and form an integral part of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).

Virtual machines require installing an operating system to run and host applications, contributing to the enormous disk space that virtual machines occupy,
which can run into Gigabytes of space.
On the other hand, containers do not have a guest OS. 
Instead, they run on the same kernel as the host OS. As a result, containers have a small footprint and typically take up a few megabytes of space,
which makes them more portable and resource-friendly than virtual machines.

Virtual machines virtualize all the hardware layers of a computer's hardware using a hypervisor, which facilitates the abstraction of underlying resources.
This results in high resource overhead since the resources are shared with the host’s operating system as well.
With containers, there is minimal overhead since there is no virtualization of hardware resources.

Containers provide standardization in the way an application runs. A containerized application will run consistently whether on a bare metal server, 
virtual machine, or cloud environment. As a result, software developers rely on containers to package microservices that make up modern applications.

With virtual machines, an application may encounter errors or inconsistencies when ported from one VM to another due to conflicts in dependencies and libraries. 
This results in commonly known as The Matrix from Hell. It’s for this reason that containers come out on top in the deployment of microservices and applications.

in summary --

Virtualization lets you run multiple operating systems on the same physical server, whereas containerization enables you to deploy multiple applications 
or microservices on the same operating system without any hardware abstraction.
